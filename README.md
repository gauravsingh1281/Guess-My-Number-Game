# 🎯 Guess My Number Game

A fun and interactive number guessing game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**!

## 🚀 About the Game

The player has to guess a hidden number between **1 and 20**. Based on the input, the game gives feedback like:

If the guess is correct:
- The hidden number is revealed
- Background color changes to **green**
- The current score is compared with the **high score** and updated if applicable
